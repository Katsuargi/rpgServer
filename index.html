				<h2 class="section-dis">Status</h2>
				<p>I'm currently attending Code Louisville to build relevant skills in web design and programming. While web design is interesting enough I find programming to be enjoyable to play around with and figure out. This page is a repository to display the various little things I develop.</p>

				<h2 class="section-dis">Text based Web RPG</h2>
				<p> In high school I played quite a few different text based browser games including RPGs. I thought this would be a good initial project because I'd be able to find a place to use just about anything I learned in JavaScript.<br><br>

				The baseline project is now finished. It features a character creation and display, a shop and shopping cart feature, a navigation process, a basic quest system, a basic leveling system, and random encounter / combat mechanic. Everything is streamlined well enough that adding new content(areas, items, monsters, quests, etc.) is the work of minutes.<br><br>

				There is room for improvement here with skills, classes, pictures, etc.<br><br>

				Navigation updated to a more general NSEW using coordinates. Other systems such as save / load updated to account for this.<br><br>

				Equipment system added and fixed. Added health potions. Added proper leveling system.</p>

				<h2 class="section-dis">Data Crunching</h2>
				<p>Data crunch for a forum game I play in. Ship design in game features parts with variable values, and different categories of parts that impact the same stats. Involves complicated trade offs for cost/effect. Tool designed to eventually crunch all legal combinations of parts within a certain range using heuristics to keep things sane. Has progressed from linear single part cruncher up to the current general 2x2 configuration. Can easily be rote worked for any number of categories + parts from here. Lacks anything beyond basic heuristics, however, so lacks more than basic usefulness.<br><br>

				Rough estimates give about 10 parts per category, and 8 categories per major stat. Current heuristics include limiting any individual part to 12 (parts have diminishing returns. This is a basic sanity check as manual testing has shown even outlier cases don't want more than 12 of a given part). (12^8)*(10^8) is still a really, really big number. To say nothing of heuristics to actually track down the values with trade offs while weeding out combinations that are just flat inferior.</p>
